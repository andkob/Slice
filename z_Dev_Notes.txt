-- Commit Notes --

I think I'm going to hang on to this current layout for now. Still temporary, but it will no longer impede development.

Visuals are much much sexier but still sloppy so i'd like to change the header and the quick links. I'll leave the output box rn only
for debugging bc it comes in handy sometimes. I think the budgeting page should be next because that's honestly part of the reason I wanted to
build this app in the first palce.

In the new buttons to control the line graph make the selected one stay a color.

-- Stuff --

1.
A user can't login without a username, but once one is entered there's no going back, which means if a mistake is made, that username
will be stuck in the database.
ik the whole login thing is a temporary solution, but think about making a database manager or something idk.
Rn deleting the database when neccessary is fine.

2.
Title doesn't change when ur in the dashboard.

Notes on the notes:
1. Yeah thats fine for now prolly ill do that if im bored. rn just deleting the database is fine for cleaning up xD
