1.
A user can't login without a username, but once one is entered there's no going back, which means if a mistake is made, that username
will be stuck in the database.
ik the whole login thing is a temporary solution, but think about making a database manager at some point.

2.
If you already have an access_token you no longer need to setup with Plaid anymore, you can just log in right away.
bc of this u should prolly incorporate a logout function maybe.

3.
Q: What's the point of a check user status function when I can access the database directly in the client.
Seems mad unsecure. It's cuz I have access to the user object but like wtf.

4.
Title doesn't change when ur in the dashboard.

More Recent Notes:
