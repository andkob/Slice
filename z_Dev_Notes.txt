I added a couple things from the transaction product. I think it's time to start get a real design going.
There's a lot I can do with what I've build so far, I just have no real way of displaying things or anything.
That is definitely the next order of business (just kinda sucks lowkey).


-- Stuff --

1.
A user can't login without a username, but once one is entered there's no going back, which means if a mistake is made, that username
will be stuck in the database.
ik the whole login thing is a temporary solution, but think about making a database manager or something idk.
Rn deleting the database when neccessary is fine.

2.
Title doesn't change when ur in the dashboard.
