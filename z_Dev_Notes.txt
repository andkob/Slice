-- Commit Notes --

As unmotivated as I was to start designing this webpage, damn does it look sexy now. Obviously I'm not gonna keep it this way, this just
gives us the change to implement more complex features much easier, as they actually have a place to go now.
Also it was lowkey more fun than I thought it would be.
Next thing I want to do is fix how transactions are shown -> Either 1. on a different page, or 2. On separate cards in the output container.
---> I actually want to do part with this output container thing as soon as we can bc after this update its now the most pussy ass part
of the project rn.



-- Stuff --

1.
A user can't login without a username, but once one is entered there's no going back, which means if a mistake is made, that username
will be stuck in the database.
ik the whole login thing is a temporary solution, but think about making a database manager or something idk.
Rn deleting the database when neccessary is fine.

2.
Title doesn't change when ur in the dashboard.

Notes on the notes:
1. Yeah thats fine for now prolly ill do that if im bored. rn just deleting the database is fine for cleaning up xD
2. bruh
