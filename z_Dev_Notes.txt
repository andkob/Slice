So leaving off, initialization works, plaid launches and successfully returns a public token.
Exchanging the public token now works successfully.

In this iteration, an SQLite database was loosely implemented.
I say loosely because I am not sure if there are things I left out, or if there is still remaining code from the "temporary database".

Right now if you want to run this, you have to delete the database.sqlite file, run the server, shut the server down because it ran into an error,
a blank database file will then exist. Then when you start the server everything should work.
If you restart the server and run it again, it will fail again due to the user already existing.

Not sure how to handle this yet because we have no log in or anything yet, so maybe just fix it so it can run as is right now.
